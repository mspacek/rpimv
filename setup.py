"""rpimv installation script

A "developer" install lets you work on or otherwise update rpimv in-place, in whatever
folder you cloned it into with git, while still being able to call `import rpimv` and use it
as a library system-wide. This creates an egg-link in your system site-packages or
dist-packages folder to the source code:

$ sudo python setup.py develop

or the equivalent using pip:

$ sudo pip3 install -e .

This will also install a bash script on your system so that you can simply type `rpimv` at the
command line to launch it from anywhere.
