A Python server for Raspberry Pi that serves IMU data over TCP.
Uses Adafruit LIS3MDL + LSM6DSOX 9 DoF sensor I2C board. Also
optionally serves GPS data from an Adafruit Ultimate GPS USB board.

To install in developer mode, including dependencies:

```
$ sudo pip3 install -e .
```

To run the server:

```
$ python3 rpimv/main.py
Serving on rpimv:1987 ...
2021-12-12 12:00:00.000000 acquire_imu
2021-12-12 12:00:00.000000 acquire_gps
2021-12-12 12:00:01.000000 acquire_imu
2021-12-12 12:00:01.000000 acquire_gps
```

or simply run the installed `rpimv` script from anywhere.

To test the server with a simple client:

```
$ python3 rpimv/client.py

```
or simply run the installed `rpimvcl` script from anywhere.

The returned comma separated IMU data are:

```
ax, ay, az, wx, wy, wz, mx, my, mz
```

Where `a*` is acceleration (m/s<sup>2</sup>), `w*` is angular velocity (rad/s),
and `m*` is magnetic field strength (uT), on all 3 axes.

The returned comma separated GPS data are:

```
latitude, longitude, elevation, fix quality, num satellites, UTC datetime
```

where latitude and longitude are in deg, and elevation is in m.

To automatically start `rpimv` in a terminal window on bootup, copy `bin/rpimv.desktop`
to `/etc/xdg/autostart/`.
